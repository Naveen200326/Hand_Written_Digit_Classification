# Handwritten Digit Classification

This project demonstrates a deep learning approach to classify handwritten digits (0–9) using the MNIST dataset. The model is built using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** implemented in TensorFlow/Keras. It learns to identify numeric patterns from thousands of handwritten digit images and predicts the correct digit with high accuracy.

The model is then **deployed using Streamlit**, allowing users to interact with it via a simple web interface. Users can upload an image or draw a digit and get real-time predictions, making it a practical showcase of computer vision and machine learning in action.
